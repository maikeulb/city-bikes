Run
---
With docker:
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
Go to http://localhost:5000 and visit one of the above endpoints
```

Alternatively, open `redis.go` and point the Redis URI to your server.

`cd` into `./city-bikes` (if you are not already); then run:
```
go build
./city-bikes
Go to http://localhost:5000 and visit one of the above endpoints
```
